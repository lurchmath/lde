We have designed the work on the Lurch Deductive Engine (LDE) to progress in
phases.  The idea is that each phase ends with a completed whole that can be
tested in that state, and that provides more features than the previous
state did.  By the time the final phase is complete, the LDE will be a
robust and useful product.

# LDE Design Phase 11: Features

This document is not yet complete.  Its content will eventually specify:

 * Add features to anything built so far (like multiple conclusions from a
   rule, or automatic premise finding, or automatic premise ordering, or
   the ability to specify metavariable instantiations, or any of 1000 other
   features we'd like to add)
 * This enables: everything else
