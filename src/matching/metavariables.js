/**
 * To facilitate marking some {@link Symbol Symbols} as metavariables (in
 * contrast to any {@link Symbol Symbol} not so marked), we declare a string
 * constant that can be used with the
 * {@link MathConcept#isA isA()} and {@link MathConcept#asA asA()} and
 * {@link MathConcept#makeIntoA makeIntoA()} functions in the
 * {@link MathConcept MathConcept} class.
 * 
 * For example, to mark a symbol `A` as a metavariable, one can import this
 * module (call it `M`) and then call `A.makeIntoA( M.metavariable )`.  You
 * can later test to see if `A` is a metavariable with
 * `A.isA( M.metavariable )`.
 * 
 * Note, however, that only {@link Symbol Symbol} instances can be used as
 * metavariables by {@link module:Matching the matching module}.  Although you
 * can mark any {@link LogicConcept LogicConcept} as a metavariable this way,
 * it is useless to do so, and other functions in this module will not
 * recognize non-{@link Symbol Symbols} as metavariables.
