/**
 * A LogicConcept is a specific type of MathConcept.  It is one that can be
 * processed by the LDE when validating the correctness of steps of a user's
 * work.  MathConcepts are more high-level, and in order to be processed by
 * the LDE, must be broken down into LogicConcepts.
 * 
 * There are three types of LogicConcepts, described only vaguley here, but
 * you can view the documentation in the appropriate subclasses for details.
 * 
 *  * An {@link Expression} is what we typically think of as a piece of
 *    mathematics--an equation, a statement, a formula, which is often
 *    enclosed in `$...$` in a LaTeX document
 *  * An {@link Environment} is any larger structure in a document that
 *    contains many expressions, such as a theorem, a proof, a section, an
 *    example, or a chain of connected equations.
 *  * A {@link Declaration} introduces a new variable or constant.  This is
 *    common in both computer programming (where many languages require us
 *    to define our variables) and in mathematics (where we say things like
 *    "Let x be an arbitrary real number" or "Let D be the constant provided
 *    by Theorem 6.1."

     * givens as saying "...then this is true."  For example, we would view the

    /**
     * This function takes putdown notation for one or more LogicConcepts and
     * builds instances of them by parsing the input, returning an array of
     * the results.  Putdown is a simple format, and so it plays on the name
     * of the famous simple format "markdown," but turns it into something
     * that sounds undesirable (and humorous?).  Putdown and Markdown have no
     * connection, neither historically nor in the format itself.
     * 
     * Putdown notation is defined as follows.
     * 
     *  * A {@link Symbol Symbol} is written using any sequence of
     *    non-whitespace characters that does not include or conflict with the
     *    special characters below.  Thus symbols are quite flexible,
     *    including things like `x` and `y` as well as `-459.7001` and
     *    `$===_-_@_-_===$` and much more.
     *  * A {@link Symbol Symbol} can also be written as a string literal
     *    whose only escape characters are `\"` inside double-quoted literals,
     *    `\'` inside single-quoted literals, and `\n` or `\\` in any case.
     *    Thus you can create just about any symbol at all, including
     *    `"{ yes it's (a symbol) }"`, which is not a compound expression, but
     *    is a single atomic symbol.
     *  * An {@link Application Application} is written using LISP notation.
     *    Function application requires at least one argument (no empty paren
     *    pairs).  For example, you might write $\sin x$ as `(sin x)`.
     *  * A {@link BindingExpression BindingExpression} is written as a series
     *    of {@link Symbol Symbols}, separated by commas, followed by another
     *    comma, and then the body expression.  All children before the body and
     *    after the first child must be {@link Symbol Symbols}, and are the
     *    bound variables.  Example:  `x , (P x)` means $P(x)$ with $x$ bound.
     *    Consequently, could write, for example, `(∀ x , (P x))` to mean the
     *    application of the `∀` symbol to the binding `x , (P x)`.
     *  * A {@link Declaration Declaration} lists the declared {@link Symbol
     *    Symbols} in brackets, followed optionally by a comma and then a
     *    body, which is any LogicConcept. that is an assumption made about the
     *    variables.  Example: `[x , (P x)]` means "Declare $x$ about which
     *    $P(x)$ is true."  This can be used for arbitrary variables (in which
     *    we would be assuming $P(x)$) or declaring constants we know to exist
     *    (in which we would be concluding $P(x)$) or for anything else the
     *    user's library wants to use declarations for.
     *  * An {@link Environment Environment} is written with its children
     *    separated by spaces and surrounded in curly brackets.  Example:
     *    `{ child1 child2 etc }`.
     *  * Any {@link Environment Environment},
     *    {@link Declaration Declaration}, or
     *    {@link Expression#isOutermost outermost Expression} can be marked
     *    as a "given" by preceding it with a colon, `:`.
     *  * Any {@link Environment Environment},
     *    {@link Declaration Declaration}, or
     *    {@link Expression Expression} can be given additional attributes by
     *    following it with `+{` and then for the rest of the line (that is,
     *    until the next newline) writing as much JSON code as you like,
     *    beginning with that initial `{`, as attributes to add to the
     *    preceding object.  For example, to add the color green to a
     *    {@link Symbol Symbol}, we might do this:
     *    `my_symbol +{"color":"green"}`.  To add more attributes than can fit
     *    on one line, simply start another `+{...}` block on the next line.
     *  * The notation `//` is used for one-line comments.  Anything after it
     *    is ignored, up until the next newline.  The previous rule has some
     *    conflict with this one, and we resolve it as follows.  If a `//`
     *    occurs before a `+{` on a line, then the `//` takes precedence and
     *    the rest of the line is a comment, so the `+{` is ignored.  But if
     *    the `+{` appears first, it takes precedence, and the rest of the
     *    line is interpreted as JSON code, so a trailing `//` comment will
     *    most likely create invalid JSON, and thus should be avoided.
     * 
     * @param {String} string - should contain putdown notation for one or
