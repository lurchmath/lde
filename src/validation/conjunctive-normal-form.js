/**
 * The CNF namespace includes tools for constructing nested JavaScript arrays
 * suitable for use in the satisfiability solver stored in the `dependencies`
 * folder in this repository.  (Credits to the author of that tool appear in
 * the documentation for {@link CNF.isSatisfiable isSatisfiable()}, below.)
 * 
 * The format used by that tool is as follows.  Assume that we have a number
 * for every propositional variable, so that we might refer to them as
 * $p_1,p_2,p_3,\ldots$.  Then an expression such as
 * 
 * $$ (p_1\vee p_2)\wedge(\neg p_2\vee p_3\vee\neg p_4) $$
 * 
 * gets encoded as follows.
 * 
 * `[ [ 1, 2 ], [ -2, 3, 4 ] ]`
 * 
 * The inner arrays are disjunctions, the outer array is conjunction (as is
 * the definition of CNF), and the integers represent propositions, or the
 * negations of them, depending on the sign of the integer.
 * 
 * Tools in this namespace let you construct CNFs for atomic propositions,
 * including:
 * 
 *  * {@link CNF.constantTrue the constrant true}
 *  * {@link CNF.constantFalse the constrant false}
 *  * {@link CNF.proposition any atomic proposition or its negation}
 * 
 * and non-atomic propositional expressions as well, including:
 * 
 *  * {@link CNF.and the conjunction of two CNFs}
 *  * {@link CNF.or the disjunction of two CNFs}
 * 
 * You can then check satisfiability of any constructed CNF with
 * {@link CNF.isSatisfiable isSatisfiable()}.
