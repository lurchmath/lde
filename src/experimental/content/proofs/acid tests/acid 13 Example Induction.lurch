// Induction vs Forall+ test
//
// This should not validates the inductive step (but currently does).  
// The reason it does is that the forall statement instantiates the ∀- rule to
// give the equation, and the forall+ and induction rules are of the form :{ :{
// :A B } C } and :{ :D :{ :A :B E } C }, but these together classically imply C
// when treated only propositionally. (The proof can be done using proof by
// cases on (B or ¬B)). So to handle this we have two options. 
//
// (a) use FIC instead of SAT, since 
//
//            { :{ :{:A B } C }  :{ :D :{ :A :B E } C } C }
//
//     is a classical tautology but not an intuitionistic one.  It's not clear if
//     this will only handle this particular case or if other similar
//     counterexamples are possible when A is a declaration using FIC.  It's also
//     slower than SAT.
//
// (b) upgrade the tick marks to use forSome style renamings for consecutive
//     Let-Assumes. In that case the above tautology will fail classically because
//     the B's will no longer match each other.  This makes Let behave almost exactly
//     like ForSome except for the Given status and preemie check, which is probably
//     a step in the right direction anyway.
