/**
 * #### Prepare an LC for Global $n$-compact Validation 
 *
 *  In the current implementation of global n-compact validation we currently
 *  make many simplifying assumptions about the nature of a document.  But they
 *  are hard to keep track of when just defined, but not codified.  So we
 *  include here routines for the phase of processing that moves things around
 *  and computes js attributes that are required for validation.
 *
 *  Interpret an LC as a document. It does the following, in order.
 *  - addSystemDeclarations(doc)
 *  - processShorthands(doc)
 *  - moveDeclaresToTop(doc)
 *  - processTheorems(doc)
 *  - processDeclarationBodies(doc)
 *  - processLetEnvironments(doc)
 *  - processBindings(doc)
 *  - processRules(doc)
 *  - assignProperNames(doc)
 *  - markDeclaredSymbols(doc) 
 * 
 *  Note: Global $n$-compact validation assumes a document
 *    has been interpreted before trying to validate and will interpret it first
 *    if you try to validate it and it hasn't been already.
 *
 * @module Interpretation

/**
 * ### Process the user's theorems 
 *
 * If a user specifies that a claim Environment is a `Theorem`, he is declaring
 * that he wants to use it as a `Rule` after that (if we enable the option to
 * allow users to enter `Theorems`... otherwise just let them enter them as
 * ordinary claim environments like proofs that aren't marked asA `Theorem` but
 * can be formatted as such). 
 *
 * But we want to mark his theorem as valid or invalid just like any other proof
 * in addition to using it as a `Rule`.  To accomplish this, we make an
 * invisible copy of the Theorem immediately following the theorem, make that a
 * formula, and label it as a `Rule` for future use.  This does not have to be
 * done if the Theorem has no metavariables as a `Rule` because it would be
 * redundant. When a Rule copy of the user's Theorem is inserted it does not
 * have to be marked as a given since it has no prop form, but its
 * instantiations do.  We flag the inserted `Rule` version of the Theorem as
 * `.userThm` to distinguish it from ordinary `Rules`.
 *
 * This has to be done after processing Shorthands and moving Declares to the
 * top so the user's theorems are in the scope of declared constants in the
 * library, which then prevents them from being metavariables. 
 *
 * If `LurchOptions.swapTheoremProofPairs` is true, and a Proof is the next
 * sibling of the Theorem, swap the two of them first before inserting the
 * `.userThm` Rule.  This prevents the Theorem from being used in its own proof,
 * which is done correctly if you don't swap them but is counterintuitive
 * because mathematicians don't usually expect it to follow the rules of
 * accessibilty in that situation.
