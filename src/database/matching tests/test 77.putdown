// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P Q)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(exists x , (@apply P x))              (exists m , (gt m 0))
	(forall y , (implies (@apply P y) Q))  (forall n , (implies (gt n 0) (gt -1 0)))
	Q                                      (gt -1 0)
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		P  (@lambda v , (gt v 0))
		Q  (gt -1 0)
	)
)
