// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables x P Q)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(exists x , (@apply P x))              (exists m , (gt m 0))
	(forall x , (implies (@apply P x) Q))  (forall m , (implies (gt m 0) (gt -1 0)))
	Q                                      (gt -1 0)
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		x  m
		P  (@lambda v , (gt v 0))
		Q  (gt -1 0)
