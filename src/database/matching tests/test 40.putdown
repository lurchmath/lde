// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables x P)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	// The following would be a solution if we permitted users to deduce
	// a conclusion that's alpha-equivalent to the explicitly permitted one,
	// but we actually don't plan to support that, and our matching algorithm
	// doesn't support it either, so we comment this "solution" out.
