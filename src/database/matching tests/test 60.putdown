// This file was autogenerated as part of an export process from an old repository.

// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P t x)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(@apply P t)               (neq x t)
	(exists x , (@apply P x))  (exists y , (neq y t))
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		P  (@lambda v , (neq v t))
		t  x
		x  y
	)
)
