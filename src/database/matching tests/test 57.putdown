// This file was autogenerated as part of an export process from an old repository.

// Declare the metavariables in this matching problem:
(metavariables P t x)

// List the pattern-expression pairs in this matching problem:
(problem
	(@apply P t)               (gt 1 0)
	(exists x , (@apply P x))  (exists x , (gt x 0))
)

// List all solutions in this matching problem:
(solutions
	( // solution 1
		P  (@lambda v , (gt v 0))
		t  1
		x  x
