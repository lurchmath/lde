testing:
  type: validation
  subtype: formula
  description: "Testing various errors in instantiation-hint blocks."
---

// Each of test of type: validation and subtype: formula begins with a
// 'document' LC (and environment in smackdown notation) followed by sequence
// of instantiation specifiers each of which give the necessary information to
// construct an instatiation of a formula in the document. 
// 
// In addition to putdown notation, the document can contain smackdown commands
// (though here we do not show them with their initial backslash, so as not to
// confuse the smackdown parser, which is not currently smart enough to skip
// comment lines):
//
//  label{abc}          - labels the preceding LC with 'abc'
//  valid, invalid      - indicates whether the preceding LC should be 
//                        valid or invalid after validation
//
// The instantiation specifiers specify the following items:
//
//    (formula abc)      - formula to instantiate has label 'abc' 
//    ((P A) (Q B))      - instantiate metavars P and Q with A and B resp.  
//    (result "valid")   - whether or not the instantiation was successfully 
//                         constructed                         
//    (reason "foo")     - if it was unable to construct the instantiation
//                         give a reason why it failed
//
// To process these tests, first the test will
//   1. Construct the LC of the document form the first section.
//      a. label commands assign labels to the appropriate LCs
//      b. valid, invalid commands assign expected validation result
//         to each conclusion to check later against the actual validation
//         result.
//   2. For each instantiation specifier it attempts to construct the
//      instantiation of the specified formula using the specified values.
//      a. If it succeeds (and was expected to), it inserts that LC into the
//         document after the formula.
//      b. If not, it checks that it failed for the expected reason
//   3. After all instantiations are constructed and inserted, all of the 
//      conclusions in the document are validated propositionally, and the
//      result of the validation checked for each conclusion to see if it 
//      matches what was expected as specified by the \valid and \invalid 
//      smackdown commands in the document.
