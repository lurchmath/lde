 * Given a sequent and a formula, is there an instantiation of the formula that,

 * that any instantiation that would make the sequent hold will be among the

 * by running them through the validation algorithm for the deductive system in

 * 
 * The default is to search for instantiations that will make the sequent true
 * when validated by {@link ValidationTools.classicalPropositionalValidator
 * classical propositional logic}.  However, if the client will be using
 * {@link ValidationTools.intuitionisticPropositionalValidator intuitionistic
 * propositional logic} instead, the results can be filterted further; simply
 * set `intuitionistic: true` in the options object.  This will not only return
 * fewer results, but also speed up the search for those results.
 * 
 * The default is to search for instantiations that will make the sequent true
 * even if the formula itself is only an intermediate step in a larger chain of
 * inferences.  However, it is often the case that the client wants the formula
 * to be the final step that achieves the sequent's conclusion (say, if a
 * student should be expected to cite a formula directly relevant to the
 * statement they're justifying).  This will significantly narrow the search
 * space and the result set and will consequently speed up the search.  Simply
 * set `direct: true` in the options object.
 * 
 * The default is to do the work silently, not generating any debugging output.
 * But if debugging a complex problem, it may help to see the inner workings of
 * this function.  Set `debug: true` in the options object to print copious
 * debugging output to the console.
 *

 * format as those returned by {@link module:Matching.allInstantiations
 * allInstantiations()}; see its documentation for details.
