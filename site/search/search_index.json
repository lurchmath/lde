            "text": "LDE Design Overview\n\n\nThis page lists the design principles adopted by the Lurch team to date\nregarding the LDE, with reasons and explanations for each.  This document\ncan be used as reference, and to guide development, but it may also be\nchanged as better ideas come along.\n\n\nTo see the specific phases of development planned for the LDE, and what's\ncompleted, use the \"Phases\" menu above.\n\n\nElegance and Simplicity\n\n\nThese are of utmost importance, because\n\n\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to explain to students or in an Advanced User's\n   Guide (AUG),\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to test because it has fewer unusual corner cases\n   or special handling of odd circumstances,\n\n\nthey make Lurch easier to implement for the same reason, and\n\n\nthey make it easier for us to be confident that our designs are good,\n   because they're easier to hold in your head and grok all at once.\n\n\n\n\nFeedback and Validation\n\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of the Lurch application is to give feedback to the\n   user about the work they type into their document.\n\n\nBecause this will often involve validating steps of work in a proof, we\n   may use the terms \"feedback\" and \"validation\" interchangeably, even\n   though technically validation is just a particular type of feedback\n   (though the most common type in our case).\n\n\nOne-Pass Validation (OPV)\n is a paradigm in which, whenever the app\n   needs to update feedback in response to changes made by the user, it\n   does so by reprocessing every bit of meaningful content from scratch, in\n   one (large, possibly time-consuming) pass over the whole document.\n\n\nReal-Time Validation (RTV)\n is a paradigm in which, whenever the app\n   needs to update feedback in response to changes made by the user, it\n   attempts to re-use as much information from previous validation as\n   possible, only updating those portions of it that need updating in\n   response to the specific change the user just made.  Thus RTV is\n   trickier to design and implement than OPV, but more efficient at\n   run-time.\n\n\nAn important concept for our test suite is that any RTV design can be\n   converted to an OPV design trivially, and then used for comparison\n   testing.  Simply replace all sophisticated RTV-style change event\n   handlers with OPV-style ones, that mark the entire document as needing\n   reprocessing.  Then any potential change that can be made to the user's\n   document can be run through each of these engines in parallel, and the\n   results compared for equivalence.\n\n\nNote that the choice of OPV vs. RTV is independent of the choice of\n   manual validation vs. automatic validation.  RTV certainly makes\n   automatic validation nicer, and thus makes manual validation less\n   appealing, but you could choose anything from among\n   \n\\{\\text{OPV},\\text{RTV}\\}\\times\\{\\text{auto},\\text{manual}\\}\n.\n\n\n\n\nLDE and UI\n\n\n\n\nWe have a paradigm in which the UI is exactly that (user interface) and\n   the LDE (Lurch Deductive Engine) is the brain that operates in one or\n   more background threads, processing what the user has given the app\n   through the UI.\n\n\nWe aim to implement every feature in the LDE if possible, but implement\n   in the UI only those features that can't be implemented in the LDE.\n   Here, \"if possible\" means that it would not break the model-view\n   paradigm to implement it in the LDE (i.e., the LDE wouldn't need to\n   speak HTML).  Reasons for this:\n\n\nThe LDE will be implemented in pure JS, no DOM, so that it can be\n  used in a WebWorker and in the unit testing suite.\n\n\nTherefore the bigger the LDE is, the more of our code has been\n  subject to rigorous unit tests.\n\n\nAnd the bigger the LDE is, the more of our code is run out of the UX\n  thread, and thus the more responsive our app is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe decisions recorded here are almost entirely about the design of the\n   LDE, not the UI.\n\n\n\n\nStructures\n\n\n\n\nDefine a \nstructure\n to be the basic unit of meaning in the LDE.\n\n\nThis includes document-level structures such as a section,\n  subsection, proof, subproof, etc., which are analogous to block-level\n  items like DIV or P in HTML, and \n\\begin{X}...\\end{X}\n in LaTeX.\n\n\nBut it also includes inline structures (SPANs in HTML, \n\\foo{...}\n or\n  \n$...$\n in LaTeX).\n\n\nStructures can be nested acyclically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamples of types of structures that we may choose to define later:\n\n\nProofs/Subproofs, with one specific flavor of it being the kind that\n  declares a variable first\n\n\nDefinitions of rules, axioms, language rules\n\n\nFormal systems (or \"mathematical topics\")\n\n\nTheorems and pairing of them with proofs\n\n\nExpressions\n\n\nMaybe variables will be declared by based on placing a variable\n  inside an expression by itself, at the head of a variable declaration\n  subproof, or maybe by creating a new structure type for variable\n  declarations, or maybe something else\n\n\nHomework problems\n\n\nExamples (an environment in which anything you declare ends its scope\n  at the end of the example, no matter what it was)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe set of structure types should equal the set of common mathematical\n   structures that mathematics students should be learning anyway, and they\n   should behave the same in Lurch as in mathematics.  This ensures that\n   Lurch doesn't add to the mathematics learning curve in this sense.\n\n\nNot every structure is permitted to contain every other type of\n   structure.  But such rules are enforced through validation, which we\n   will not be defining for some time yet, so this comment is just a\n   preview of what's to come.  For instance, expressions can contain only\n   other expressions.\n\n\nAt some later point, we may care about the meanings of structures, so\n   that they can be used as premises in proofs.  At such a time, we will\n   ensure that a structure's meaning includes the unjustified steps in the\n   structure (which function as premises), the final step in the structure\n   (which functions as its conclusion), any variables declared within it\n   (which are bound in it), and so on, but it is not necessary to define\n   those details yet.  I mention them here merely so that the idea is not\n   lost.\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\n\n\n\n\nA structure A is accessible to a structure B if some ancestor structure\n   of B (possibly B itself) is a sibling of A, but A is the (strictly)\n   earlier of the two siblings within their parent structure.\n\n\nEquivalently, we can speak of \"scope\" rather than accessibility.  The\n   scope of a structure A is all later siblings of A in the same parent,\n   along with all their descendants.  Thus B is in the scope of A iff A is\n   accessible to B.\n\n\n\n\nAttributes\n\n\n\n\nEvery structure contains a key-value dictionary called \nattributes,\n\n   which are read-only from the point of view of the LDE, and are\n   read-write from the point of view of the UI.  From the LDE's point of\n   view, they come from elsewhere (the UI).\n\n\n\n\nDocument\n\n\n\n\nThe entire document will be represented to the LDE as a single\n   structure, usually with a nonzero number of inner structures.\n\n\nWe call the representation of the entire document as a structure the LDE\n   Document, a phrase chosen to connote \"the LDE's view of the document,\n   not the one the user sees in the UI.\"\n\n\nOne main job of the UI is to convert from what the user sees into the\n   LDE Document.\n\n\nSo to the list of structure types above, add \"Document.\"\n\n\nThe entire LDE Document data structure will live inside the LDE module.\n   In the main Lurch app, this implies that the LDE Document will be stored\n   in the background thread where the LDE runs, not in the UI.  Thus the UI\n   will communicate across threads to create the LDE Document.  Details on\n   this later.\n\n\n\n\nSome brief UI comments\n\n\n\n\nMost of the purpose of the UI will be to convert the HTML document the\n   user sees into the LDE Document the LDE processes, then to show the user\n   in the HTML document and feedback the LDE sends back.\n\n\nIn service to that purpose, the UI contains many (largely independent\n  and usually small) features for encoding the HTML document into the\n  LDE Document.\n\n\nExamples include conventions for processing groups, connections,\n  numbered lists, section headings, finding meaning in text through\n  regular expressions, and the meanings of various LaTeX-like\n  \n\\shortcuts\n.\n\n\nA document author chooses which subset of these features to enable by\n  making choices in the document settings dialog.  Those settings are\n  stored in document metadata, and propagate to dependencies (defined\n  below).\n\n\nThe UI will have very little hard-coded (i.e., non-customizable)\n  procedures for interpreting the HTML document into the LDE document;\n  the settings above are highly choosable by the user.\n\n\nThe only constrained interpretation conventions (i.e., few or no\n  options for changing the interpretation) would be those that have\n  mathematical names, such as \"proof,\" which have a specific meaning\n  that it would be educationally counterproductive to interpret another\n  way.\n\n\nIn addition, we may choose a specific set of document settings to use\n  throughout the standard libraries that ship with Lurch, to show best\n  practices and help users with consistency and predictability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther UI details:\n\n\nBecause we have a UI that allows users to make connections among\n  groups, the structures in the hierarchy may include, among their\n  attributes, a binary, edge-labeled multigraph.  (Note that this does\n  not require that every connection in the HTML document become two\n  Structures in the LDE Document with attributes connecting them.  Nor\n  does it stipulate that some concept--such as labeling--that we might\n  decide to represent as part of this multigraph can't also be\n  represented sometimes in another way as well.)\n\n\nIf we require the LDE to send a signal when validation completes,\n  then we can make a UI setting of whether to show feedback as the\n  feedback arrives, or only after the \"all validation complete\" signal\n  arrives (and thus feedback has stabilized).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStructures are OOP Objects\n\n\n\n\nA structure exposes a set of data and methods about its internal state\n   to the rest of the app, in much the same way as Objects in OOP do, with\n   the type of structure (from the list above, e.g., Theorem or Example)\n   functioning as the \"class\" of the Object.\n\n\nSome methods in a structure will be time-intensive to run, and thus\n   should use an asynchronous paradigm, queueing the tasks for running when\n   the LDE thread has time.  The most time-intensive tasks, such as\n   matching and parsing, may be delegated to yet other background threads\n   by the LDE thread.\n\n\n\n\nExporting data from structures\n\n\n\n\nHere is an important example method that all structures should have\n   (though each class may implement it differently):\n\n\nA method that reports which structures (usually child structures of\n  A), if any, are to be made accessible to any structure B in the scope\n  of A (thus changing the normal scoping rules).\n\n\nThe flexibility inherent in the vagueness of this exporting notion is\n  useful.  For instance, a single theorem in the document might be\n  encoded in the LDE document as having many children, some of which\n  are its various interpretations as a rule of inference, and export\n  them all, so that any can be used/cited later.\n\n\nNote that the exports method need not copy child structures directly\n  for exporting.  It may combine/manipulate/compute structures to\n  export based on its children in any way.  Thus \"scope\" is a simple\n  and clean definition, which this function sort of indirectly extends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe will define much of the functionality of the LDE as the various\n   structures in the document calling methods in one another, which is\n   simple and elegant.  But it requires that we carefully track and cache\n   the clean/dirty status of each structure, to retain efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nDependencies as a special case\n\n\n\n\nThe current paradigm (already implemented) in webLurch is that a\n   dependency must specify what data it exports to any document that\n   depends on it.\n\n\nSuch data will be stored in the dependency document's metadata, so that\n   documents depending on it can easily import it.  It will include\n   anything that the dependency imported from its dependencies, and so on\n   to arbitrary depth.\n\n\nBecause we now require every structure to know what it exports to later\n   structures, the question of what a document exports is simply a special\n   case of that.  The document is itself a structure, and thus it can\n   already answer the \"what does this document export?\" question.\n\n\nRecall from above that one of the pieces of data that a document will\n   export is its document settings, as described earlier.\n\n\n\n\nDesign Phases\n\n\n\n\nThe question, \"Which structure should be designed first?\" is tricky\n   because each structure is rather complex, and they're rather\n   interdependent.\n\n\nOne approach would be to design each structure incrementally, adding\n   features in phases.\n\n\nThus we might begin with an LDE implementation that has just a few\n   features for a few structure types, and yet is sufficient for building\n   very simply Lurch libraries.\n\n\nThis lets us build familiarity and knowledge as we do the design, so\n   we're better at it by the time we get to the hard stuff.\n\n\nPhases 2, 3, and so on can add features and structure types, thus\n   enabling more and more sophisticated Lurch libraries, until we have\n   reached the level of power that supports a first proof course.\n\n\n\n\nHow to design support for new concepts\n\n\n\n\nBegin with how the new concept will be represented in the Output Tree\n   (OT).  As you do so, respect these constraints.\n\n\nThe OT is pure data that the user never sees, so we are free to store\n  things there without concern for how they will appear to users.\n\n\nThe OT must support validation, so we are constrained to storing\n  things there in a way that makes it easy to write and maintain\n  validation algorithms.\n\n\nValidation is complicated, and yet it must be 100% airtight and\n  correct; therefore we don't want our data storage decisions to add\n  any unnecessary complexity to validation and/or the OT.\n\n\nAs a consequence, there should be one unique, canonical way to store\n  any given concept in the OT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen ask \nbriefly\n how the concept will show up in the main Lurch UI.\n\n\nAdmit up front that it is something that will expand a lot with\n  time.  That is, whatever we design now will be the tip of the iceberg\n  of ideas that will occur to us over the coming years, and we should\n  accept that up front and plan for that as best we can.\n\n\nStart by listing the few ways that you already know that the new\n  feature will show up in the UI, simultaneously admitting that it is\n  just a sample of the ways that the feature might eventually appear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome to the middle of the pipeline, the Input Tree (IT), whose job is to\n   bridge between the UI and the OT.  Recall that the UI will have many ways\n   to represent the new features, and the OT only one.  There are two steps\n   of translation between there that could possibly handle the conversion:\n   Should the UI-to-InputTree phase handle it, or should interpretation\n   handle it, or some combination?  Decide based on these guidelines:\n\n\nThe UI-to-IT conversion does not know about the array of accessible\n  nodes, nor does it know about any of their semantics.  Only the\n  interpretation phase can depend on the semantics of all nodes\n  accessible to the one being interpreted.  So if that information is\n  relevant, the computation must be pushed to the interpretation\n  phase.  For instance, if some feature needs to know what variables\n  are declared and in scope, it would need to wait for the\n  interpretation phase, which will have access to all accessible nodes,\n  including all declarations.\n\n\nOnly the UI knows about any of its features that are specific to that\n  UI.  For instance in the main UI, there may be features specific to\n  HTML and/or mouse events, or in a LaTeX package there may be features\n  specific to LaTeX.  Obviously such features must be handled in the\n  UI-to-IT conversion, because they depend upon the specific UI in\n  which they were invented.\n\n\nIf the previous guidelines do not apply, prefer doing the work in the\n  interpretation phase rather than the UI-to-IT phase, for these\n  reasons:\n\n\nDoing so makes the whole LDE better, rather than just making one\n     of its UIs better.\n\n\nThe interpretation phase can be converted into a queue and handled\n     efficiently, so adding computation burden to it is better than\n     adding computation burden where such efficiency measures are not\n     available.\n\n\nKeep in mind at all times that the features in the UI that\n  interpretation must support are just an example set that will grow\n  over time, so try to design an interpretation phase that can easily\n  be expanded also, to be ready for such later expansion in the UI.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee other documentation on this site for the contents of each design phase.",

The UI will have very little hard-coded (i.e., non-customizable)\n  procedures for interpreting the HTML document into the LDE document;\n  the settings above are highly choosable by the user.  The only constrained interpretation conventions (i.e., few or no\n  options for changing the interpretation) would be those that have\n  mathematical names, such as \"proof,\" which have a specific meaning\n  that it would be educationally counterproductive to interpret another\n  way.  In addition, we may choose a specific set of document settings to use\n  throughout the standard libraries that ship with Lurch, to show best\n  practices and help users with consistency and predictability.    Other UI details:  Because we have a UI that allows users to make connections among\n  groups, the structures in the hierarchy may include, among their\n  attributes, a binary, edge-labeled multigraph.  (Note that this does\n  not require that every connection in the HTML document become two\n  Structures in the LDE Document with attributes connecting them.  Nor\n  does it stipulate that some concept--such as labeling--that we might\n  decide to represent as part of this multigraph can't also be\n  represented sometimes in another way as well.)  If we require the LDE to send a signal when validation completes,\n  then we can make a UI setting of whether to show feedback as the\n  feedback arrives, or only after the \"all validation complete\" signal\n  arrives (and thus feedback has stabilized).",

The flexibility inherent in the vagueness of this exporting notion is\n  useful.  For instance, a single theorem in the document might be\n  encoded in the LDE document as having many children, some of which\n  are its various interpretations as a rule of inference, and export\n  them all, so that any can be used/cited later.  Note that the exports method need not copy child structures directly\n  for exporting.  It may combine/manipulate/compute structures to\n  export based on its children in any way.  Thus \"scope\" is a simple\n  and clean definition, which this function sort of indirectly extends.    We will define much of the functionality of the LDE as the various\n   structures in the document calling methods in one another, which is\n   simple and elegant.

            "text": "Begin with how the new concept will be represented in the Output Tree\n   (OT).  As you do so, respect these constraints.  The OT is pure data that the user never sees, so we are free to store\n  things there without concern for how they will appear to users.  The OT must support validation, so we are constrained to storing\n  things there in a way that makes it easy to write and maintain\n  validation algorithms.  Validation is complicated, and yet it must be 100% airtight and\n  correct; therefore we don't want our data storage decisions to add\n  any unnecessary complexity to validation and/or the OT.  As a consequence, there should be one unique, canonical way to store\n  any given concept in the OT.    Then ask  briefly  how the concept will show up in the main Lurch UI.  Admit up front that it is something that will expand a lot with\n  time.  That is, whatever we design now will be the tip of the iceberg\n  of ideas that will occur to us over the coming years, and we should\n  accept that up front and plan for that as best we can.  Start by listing the few ways that you already know that the new\n  feature will show up in the UI, simultaneously admitting that it is\n  just a sample of the ways that the feature might eventually appear.    Come to the middle of the pipeline, the Input Tree (IT), whose job is to\n   bridge between the UI and the OT.  Recall that the UI will have many ways\n   to represent the new features, and the OT only one.  There are two steps\n   of translation between there that could possibly handle the conversion:\n   Should the UI-to-InputTree phase handle it, or should interpretation\n   handle it, or some combination?  Decide based on these guidelines:  The UI-to-IT conversion does not know about the array of accessible\n  nodes, nor does it know about any of their semantics.  Only the\n  interpretation phase can depend on the semantics of all nodes\n  accessible to the one being interpreted.  So if that information is\n  relevant, the computation must be pushed to the interpretation\n  phase.  For instance, if some feature needs to know what variables\n  are declared and in scope, it would need to wait for the\n  interpretation phase, which will have access to all accessible nodes,\n  including all declarations.  Only the UI knows about any of its features that are specific to that\n  UI.  For instance in the main UI, there may be features specific to\n  HTML and/or mouse events, or in a LaTeX package there may be features\n  specific to LaTeX.  Obviously such features must be handled in the\n  UI-to-IT conversion, because they depend upon the specific UI in\n  which they were invented.  If the previous guidelines do not apply, prefer doing the work in the\n  interpretation phase rather than the UI-to-IT phase, for these\n  reasons:  Doing so makes the whole LDE better, rather than just making one\n     of its UIs better.  The interpretation phase can be converted into a queue and handled\n     efficiently, so adding computation burden to it is better than\n     adding computation burden where such efficiency measures are not\n     available.  Keep in mind at all times that the features in the UI that\n  interpretation must support are just an example set that will grow\n  over time, so try to design an interpretation phase that can easily\n  be expanded also, to be ready for such later expansion in the UI.

So far it supports only the\nfunctionality documented below, which will grow with time.\n\n\nThe Input Tree\n\n\nThe module initializes a single \nInputStructure\n instance in a global\nvariable, which can be queried with the public API function\n\ngetInputTree()\n.  It begins life as a freshly created \nInputStructure\n with\nno attributes, but an ID.\n\n\nThis structure is called the \nInput Tree,\n and is the structure in which the\nLDE stores all input passed from the client.  In particular, the LDE never\nmodifies this structure except at the request of the client.\n\n\nThe phases by which the Input Tree is processed into the Output Tree and\nvalidated are discussed \nin a separate document\n.\n\n\nManipulating the Input Tree\n\n\nThe Input Tree can be manipulated with seven functions in the public API of\nthis module.\n\n\nFunctions for manipulating \nStructure\ns\n\n\n\n\ninsertStructure(structureToInsert,parentID,insertionIndex)\n inserts a\n   new \nInputStructure\n within the Input Tree, as follows:\n\n\nstructureToInsert\n should be either the structure to insert or the\n  serialized version thereof (optionally created with \n.toJSON()\n in an\n  \nInputStructure\n instance).  After the structure is deserialized (if\n  needed) and inserted into the document, \ntrackIDs()\n will be called\n  in it; for more information on that function, see \nits entry in the\n  API docs\n.  Note that if the deserialized\n  object is not an \nInputStructure\n instance, \ninsertStructure()\n does\n  nothing.\n\n\nparentID\n is the ID of the parent under which this new child should\n  be inserted.  This must be a string ID that belongs to a structure\n  already in the Input Tree.  If it is not, \ninsertStructure()\n does\n  nothing.  Note that the root of the hierarchy is given the ID \"root\"\n  at the time the module is loaded.\n\n\ninsertionIndex\n is the index of the child to insert, which must be\n  greater than or equal to zero and less than or equal to the number of\n  children of the parent.  If that constraint does not hold,\n  \ninsertStructure()\n does nothing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndeleteStructure(ID)\n deletes from the Input Tree the structure with the\n   given ID, which is interpreted with the same conventions as the\n   \nparentID\n is for the \ninsertStructure()\n function.  After the structure\n   is deleted, \nuntrackIDs()\n will be called in it; for more information on\n   that function, see \nits entry in the API docs\n.\n\n\nreplaceStructure(ID,newStructure)\n replaces the structure with the\n   given ID with the given new structure.\n\n\nID\n is interpreted with the same conventions as the \nparentID\n is for\n  the \ninsertStructure()\n function\n\n\nnewStructure\n is a structure (optionally serialized), as\n  \nstructureToInsert\n is for the \ninsertStructure()\n function (and\n  again, if it is not an \nInputStructure\n instance or the serialization\n  of one, this function does nothing)\n\n\nAfter this operation, \nuntrackIDs()\n will be called in the replaced\n  structure and \ntrackIDs()\n in the replacement; for more information\n  on those functions, see\n  \ntheir entries in the API docs\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsetStructureAttribute(ID,key,value)\n modifies a single attribute of a\n   structure within the Input Tree, as follows:\n\n\nID\n is interpreted with the same conventions as the \nparentID\n is for\n  the \ninsertStructure()\n function\n\n\nkey\n is the key of the attribute to create or overwrite.  If this\n  key happens to be \"id\", then the class-level tracking of IDs will be\n  updated to respect the change.  This is not permitted to begin with an\n  underscore; such key names are reserved for internal use by the LDE.\n  If the given key begins with an underscore, this function does\n  nothing.\n\n\nvalue\n is the new value, which must be JSON data.  (No checks are\n  done to verify that it is JSON data, but errors will transpire\n  eventually if non-JSON data is passed.)  Alternately, \nvalue\n can be\n  \nundefined\n, which will serve to delete the old key-value pair from\n  the attributes without replacing it with any new key-value pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunctions for manipulating connections\n\n\n\n\ninsertConnection(sourceID,targetID,connectionData)\n inserts a new\n   connection between two existing \nInputStructure\n instances, as follows:\n\n\nsourceID\n must be the ID of an \nInputStructure\n already in the Input\n  Tree.  If not, this function does nothing.\n\n\ntargetID\n must be the ID of an \nInputStructure\n already in the Input\n  Tree.  If not, this function does nothing.  It is acceptable for the\n  source and target to be the same node; connections from a thing to\n  itself are permitted.\n\n\nconnectionData\n an object containing arbitrary JSON data about the\n  new connection.  It must at least contain a field whose key is \n\"id\"\n\n  and whose value is a new, unique ID (which no connection has yet).\n  If this is not satisfied, this function does nothing.  If all the\n  above conditions are satisfied, a new connection is formed from the\n  source to the target with the given data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nremoveConnection(ID)\n deletes from the Input Tree the connection with\n   the given ID, which must be the unique ID of a connection given to the\n   \ninsertConnection()\n function documented immediately above, otherwise,\n   this function does nothing.  If it is a valid connection ID, then the\n   connection is removed from the Input Tree and the ID is available to be\n   used again.\n\n\nsetConnectionAttribute(ID,key,value)\n modifies a single attribute of a\n   connection within the Input Tree, as follows:\n\n\nID\n is interpreted just as in \nremoveConnection()\n, above.\n\n\nkey\n is the key of the attribute to create or overwrite.  This may\n  not be the string \n\"id\"\n, which is already used to store the\n  connection's unique ID, which cannot be changed.  (If this is \n\"id\"\n,\n  this function does nothing.)\n\n\nvalue\n is the new value, which must be JSON data.  (No checks are\n  done to verify that it is JSON data, but errors will transpire\n  eventually if non-JSON data is passed.)  Alternately, \nvalue\n can be\n  \nundefined\n, which will serve to delete the old key-value pair from\n  the attributes without replacing it with any new key-value pair.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsynchronous API\n\n\nIf the LDE detects that it is being run in a background thread, it will set\nup listeners for messages from the parent thread.  These listeners will\nhandle messages of four types (\ninsertStructure\n, \ndeleteStructure\n,\n\nreplaceStructure\n, \nsetStructureAttribute\n, and \ngetInputTree\n) mirroring\nthe four functions given above (plus \ngetInputTree()\n) and calling them\ninternally.\n\n\nThey can be called by passing a message of the form \n[ command, args... ]\n,\nwhere the command is a string (one of \n\"insertStructure\"\n,\n\n\"deleteStructure\"\n, etc.) and the arguments list is the same list that\nwould be passed to the function itself, as documented above.\n\n\nFor example, you could start an LDE in a WebWorker and insert a new\n\nInputStructure\n as the first child of its global document as follows.\n\n\n    // import the lde.js file (kept in the release/ folder)\n    // (This requires having the structure.js file in the same folder.)\n    var worker = new Worker( 'lde.js' );\n    var A = new InputStructure();\n    worker.postMessage( [ 'insertStructure', A.toJSON(), 'root', 0 ] );\n\n\n\n\nBecause message passing across thread boundaries can only transfer JSON\ndata, the versions of \ninsertStructure()\n and \nreplaceStructure()\n that take\n\nInputStructure\n instances will need to be called with serialized\n\nInputStructure\ns instead.\n\n\nOnly one of these five functions sends a message back to the parent context.\nIf you post a \ngetInputTree\n message (which requires no parameters), you\nwill immediately get a message in response whose event has the following\nproperties.\n\n\n\n\nevent.data.type\n is the string \n\"getInputTree\"\n.\n\n\nevent.data.payload\n is the JSON representation of the entire Input Tree,\n   as serialized by \nStructure.toJSON()\n.\n\n\n\n\nReceiving Feedback\n\n\nThe LDE will occasionally need to send feedback to the client about the\ninput provided to it.  This takes different forms, depending on how the LDE\nhas been loaded.\n\n\n\n\nIf the LDE has been loaded into a node.js application as a module, using\n   \nrequire()\n, then the module will have a member called \nFeedback\n, an\n   instance of \nEventEmitter\n.  Clients can listen for feedback events by\n   calling \ntheModule.Feedback.addEventListener('feedback',f)\n, with their\n   own function \nf\n.  That function will be called with one argument when\n   the LDE generates feedback, a JSON object with feedback data.  The most\n   important field in the object is the \nsubject\n field, which will contain\n   the ID of the \nInputStructure\n instance to which the feedback pertains.\n\n\nIf the LDE has been loaded into the browser directly (not in a WebWorker\n   instance, but in the UI thread) then it installs a \nFeedback\n object in\n   the \nwindow\n namespace.  The client can listen to events by calling\n   \nwindow.Feedback.addEventListener('feedback',f)\n, and \nf\n will be called\n   with an event \nE\n such that \nE.data\n has the structure described in the\n   previous bullet point (e.g., \nE.data.subject\n is an \nInputStructure\n ID).\n\n\nIf the LDE has been loaded into a node.js application in a background\n   thread, using Workers, then it will occasionally post messages to the\n   parent context when one of its computations requires sending feedback\n   about the result.  If the LDE is loaded into a worker \nW\n, then you can\n   listen for such messages with \nW.onmessage = function (event) {...}\n.\n   Feedback events passed to such a handler will have \nevent.type\n equal to\n   the string \n\"feedback\"\n and \nevent.payload\n equal to the feedback data\n   itself as documented in the previous two bullet points (e.g.,\n   \nevent.payload.subject\n an \nInputStructure\n ID).\n\n\n\n\nFor an example of how this works, see\n\nthe unit tests regarding feedback in the LDE\n.\n\n\nTypes of feedback\n\n\nWe will establish conventions about the \ntype\n attribute of the feedback\nobject.  A predefined list of string constants will be permitted as \ntype\ns,\neach with a meaning specified here, so that various clients and user\ninterfaces can decide how best to express these meanings to their users.\n(Sending the short strings given here rather than their detailed meanings\nalso makes the LDE ready for localization and more efficient in the amount\nof data it transmits.)\n\n\n\n\n\"updated LDE state\"\n - feedback of this type means that the LDE has just\n   finished recomputing the Output Tree from the Input Tree, and these can\n   now be queried using the \ngetInternalState()\n function of the LDE.\n   (Validation has not necessarily yet begun.)\n\n\n\"interpretation error\"\n - feedback of this type means that an internal\n   error occurred (at the level of the JavaScript implementation of the LDE\n   or one of its \nStructure\n subclasses) when trying to interpret the Input\n   Tree, and thus the Output Tree has not been updated.  In this case, the\n   \ndetails\n member of the feedback object will have a brief, English phrase\n   summarizing the problem.\n\n\n\"dirty loop\"\n - feedback of this type means that some \nInputStructure\n\n   tried to mark dirty another \nInputStructure\n whose interpretation had\n   already begun.  This could lead to an infinite loop of interpretation,\n   and thus it is disallowed, sending this feedback to help in debugging.\n\n\n\"connection removed\"\n - feedback of this type means that an illegal\n   connection was formed in the Output Tree by the interpretation procedure,\n   and that connection was severed.  \"Illegal\" means it connected a node in\n   the Output Tree to some \nStructure\n not in the Output Tree.  The feedback\n   will also contain an \nid\n field containing the unique ID of the\n   connection that was severed.\n\n\n\"validation queueing\"\n - feedback of this type means that the LDE is\n   just about to enqueue for validation an \nOutputStructure\n instance.  The\n   \nsubject\n will be its corresponding origin \nInputStructure\n.  We call\n   this just before enqueueing in case the structure has a synchronous\n   validation routine that will return immediately after enqueueing.\n\n\n\"validation complete\"\n - feedback of this type means that the LDE has\n   completed the entire validation phase.  No validation for any structure\n   is still running.  The \nsubject\n field will be \"OT root\".\n\n\n\"validation result\"\n - feedback of this type will be about one\n   particular node in the Input Tree (as its subject) and will contain the\n   validation computed for that node.  It will contain at least a \nvalidity\n\n   field which will be one of three strings: \"valid\", \"invalid\", or\n   \"indeterminate\".",

In both cases, the trees' nodes are instances of this class\n(\nStructure\n).  In particular, the Input Tree is composed of\n\nInputStructure\n instances (a direct subclass of \nStructure\n) and the Output\nTree is composed of \nOutputStructure\n instances (another direct subclass).\nSee also \nthe API documentation for the \nInputStructure\n class and its\nsubclasses\n.\n\n\nWe build into this base class all the functionality that must be present at\nevery point in those hierarchies, and leave to subclasses that functionality\nthat makes sense only for specific types of structures.  For instance, this\nclass contains no functionality to support rules of inference, because they\nare one specific type of \nOutputStructure\n, so their functionality will be\nimplemented in a subclass for that purpose.\n\n\nConstructing and Serialization\n\n\nThere is one constructor for the class\n(\nsee source code\n):\n\n\nStructure(child1,child2,...)\n creates a new instance, with the given list\nof children, each of which must be a \nStructure\n instance (or it will be\nignored).  All such children are removed from any old parent they had before\nbeing inserted into this newly created one.\n\n\nInstances can be converted to and from JSON, for saving to a file, storing\npermanently anywhere, or transmitting across threads or network connections.\nTo ensure that deserialization correctly reconstructs instances of the right\nsubclass of \nStructure\n, each subclass must be registered.  To do so, we\nprovide the \naddSubclass\n function.  Use it like so.\n\n\nJavaScript:\n\n\n    MySubclass = function ( /* ... */ ) { /* ... */ };\n    // ...\n    MySubclass.prototype.className = Structure.addSubclass( 'MySubclass', MySubclass );\n\n\n\n\nCoffeeScript, somewhere inside the class definition:\n\n\n    class MySubclass extends Structure\n        # ...\n        className : Structure.addSubclass 'MySubclass', MySubclass\n        # ...\n\n\n\n\nThen one can serialize and deserialize any hierarchy containing \nStructure\n\ninstances, as well as instances of its subclasses, using the member function\n\nsomeInstance.toJSON()\n (which obviously yields a JSON structure) or the\nclass function \nStructure.fromJSON(data)\n, which accepts JSON data created\nfrom the first function.\n\n\nSerializing a structure preserves its class, its attributes (\ndocumented\nbelow\n), and the hierarchy for which\nit is the root.\n\n\nStructure hierarchies\n\n\nTo navigate or alter a hierarchy of \nStructure\n instances, use the\nfollowing member functions present in each instance.\n\n\n\n\ninstance.parent()\n yields the parent structure, or \nnull\n if there is\n   no parent (i.e., the instance is the root of a hierarchy)\n\n\ninstance.children()\n yields an array containing the children structures,\n   in order, or an empty array if there are none\n\n\ninstance.indexInParent()\n yields the index of the child in its parent's\n   ordered list of children, or unddefined if the instance has no parent\n\n\ninstance.previousSibling()\n and \ninstance.nextSibling()\n yield the\n   adjacent structure in the parent's child list, forward or backward, as\n   expected, or undefined if there is no such sibling\n\n\ninstance.removeFromParent()\n drops the instance from it's parent's list\n   of children (thereby decreasing the length of that child list by 1) and\n   thus making \ninstance.parent()\n null\n\n\ninstance.removeChild(index)\n is a convenience equivalent to\n   \ninstance.children()[index].removeFromParent()\n\n\ninstance.insertChild(child,index)\n expects a structure instance as the\n   first argument and an index into the children list as the second.  It\n   inserts the new child at that index, thus increasing the number of\n   children by 1.  You may use an index equal to the length of the child\n   list to append.  The child is removed from its previous parent, if any,\n   before being inserted here.\n\n\ninstance.replaceWith(other)\n expects another structure instance as its\n   argument.  It removes \ninstance\n from its parent, if there is one, and\n   then inserts \nother\n at the same index in the parent, thus replacing\n   \ninstance\n.  This has no effect if \ninstance\n has no parent.  It is\n   equivalent to successive calls to \nremoveFromParent()\n and\n   \ninsertChild()\n at the instance and its parent, respectively.\n\n\ninstance.copy()\n makes a deep copy of the instance, including all nodes\n   below it in the hierarchy.  This new copy will have all the same IDs as\n   the previous copy, so to preserve uniqueness of IDs, you will usually\n   want to call \ncopiedInstance.clearIDs()\n afterwards.\n\n\n\n\nThe order of nodes in the hierarchy is often important.  We have one simple\norder relation on the nodes in the hierarchy and one more complex.  The\nsimplest is just whether node A is \"earlier than\" node B, in the order\ninduced by an in-order tree traversal (that is, the order in which the open\nparentheses would appear if the tree were written as a LISP expression).\nThis relation can be tested with \ninstance.isEarlierThan(other)\n.\n\n\nThe more complex order relation is accessibility, which we do not define\nhere, because it is already defined \nin the source code\ndocumentation\n.\nThat relation is implemented with the following member functions available\nin all instances of the class.\n\n\n\n\nA.isAccessibleTo(B)\n implements the relation as defined at the link\n   given above.\n\n\nA.isInTheScopeOf(B)\n is equivalent to \nB.isAccessibleTo(A)\n.\n\n\nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n yields an \"iterator\" object, which is an\n   object that can produce the list of nodes accessible to \nA\n by repeated\n   calls to the \nnext()\n member of the object.  Consider the following\n   JavaScript code that would use such an iterator.\n\n\n\n\n    var iterator = A.iteratorOverAccessibles();\n    var accessible;\n    while ( accessible = iterator.next() ) {\n        console.log( 'The next accessible structure is:',\n            accessible.toJSON() );\n    }\n\n\n\n\nNodes are produced by the iterator in reverse order (under the\n\nisEarlierThan\n relation) starting from the first accessible node before\n\nA\n.  When the \nnext()\n function yields null for the first time, the end of\nthe list has been reached.  (The \nnext()\n function will yield null forever\nthereafter.)\n\n\nIterators are more efficient than producing the entire list and returning\nit, because the client may be seeking just one particular node in the list,\nand thus producing the entire list so that the client can search just a\nsmall part of it could be wasteful.\n\n\nThere is an analogous function for scopes.\n\n\n\n\nA.iteratorOverScope()\n functions like \nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n, but\n   walks forwards through the structure, including precisely those nodes for\n   which \nB.isInTheScopeOf(A)\n holds true.\n\n\n\n\nThere are then four functions that use these iterators under the hood.\nClients will most likely wish to use these rather than have direct access\nto the iterators.\n\n\n\n\nA.firstAccessible(P)\n expects \nP\n to be a one-place predicate (that is,\n   a JavaScript function that can be evaluated on a single argument, and\n   yields true or false in each case) and yields the first item on the\n   \"accessibles\" list (as given by \nA.iteratorOverAccessibles()\n) for which\n   \nP\n yields true.  It returns undefined if there is no such thing.\n\n\nA.firstInScope(P)\n expects \nP\n to be a one-place predicate, as just\n   defined, and behaves just like \nfirstAccessible()\n, except it walks\n   through \nA.iteratorOverScope()\n instead.\n\n\nA.allAccessibles(P)\n expects \nP\n as in the previous two functions, and\n   yields all nodes accessible to \nA\n that satisfy \nP\n, in the same order\n   they would be reported by \niteratorOverAccessibles()\n.\n\n\nA.allInScope(P)\n expects \nP\n as in the previous two functions, and\n   yields all nodes in the scope of \nA\n that satisfy \nP\n, in the same order\n   they would be reported by \niteratorOverScope()\n.\n\n\n\n\nStructure attributes\n\n\nThe following functions available in each instance of the structure class\nsupport attributes.\n\n\n\n\ninstance.getAttribute(key)\n looks up attributes by a given string \nkey\n.\n\n\ninstance.setAttribute(key,value)\n stores attributes under a given\n   string \nkey\n with value \nvalue\n, which should be a JSON structure (or\n   atomic data).  No check is made to verify that the value is of this\n   type, but errors will transpire later if this condition is not satisfied\n   (specifically, serialization errors).\n\n\ninstance.clearAttributes(key1,key2,...)\n removes the key-value pairs\n   of attributes associated with any of the keys passed as parameters.  It\n   is acceptable to pass any number of keys, including just one.  If zero\n   are passed, \nall\n key-value pairs are removed.\n\n\ninstance.attr(object)\n adds all attributes of the given object as\n   attributes to the instance, and returns the instance itself.  This is\n   useful when constructing hierarchies, as follows.\n\n\n\n\n    var A = new Structure(\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { name : 'example structure' } ),\n        ( new Structure() ).attr( { color : '#99ff00' } )\n    );\n\n\n\n\nYou may not use attribute keys that begin with an underscore.  These are\nreserved for internal use.\n\n\nConnections\n\n\nStructure hierarchies support the notion of making connections (directed\nedges, in the graph theory sense) between any two nodes in a hierarchy.\n(Actually, between any two \nStructure\n instances at all, but typically we\nuse it within the same hierarchy.)  Each such edge can have arbitrary JSON\ndata attached to it.\n\n\nTo enable this feature, we expose the following functions from the\n\nStructure\n class.  They will function only if both ends of the connection\nhave a unique ID, as documented \nbelow\n.\n\n\nTo create or destroy connections, use these functions:\n\n\n\n\nsource.connectTo(target,data)\n, where \nsource\n and \ntarget\n are\n   \nStructure\n instances and \ndata\n is an object containing the JSON data of\n   connection, which must at least contain the connection's unique ID in the\n   \n\"id\"\n field.  There can be multiple connections between the same two\n   structures, even with the same JSON data, except for their unique IDs.\n   Returns true if the connection was formed, false if some error prevented\n   it (such as the destination not being a structure, or not having an ID,\n   or the source not having an ID, or the connection ID already in use).\n\n\nStructure.disconnect(connectionID)\n undoes the previous operation.\n   Returns true on success or false on failure (for example, if there were\n   no connection with that ID).\n\n\nStructure.setConnectionData(connectionID,key,value)\n can be called after\n   a connection was already formed to update its data.\n\n\nmyStructure.removeAllConnections()\n does exactly what it sounds like;\n   the \nStructure\n will then have no connections in or out.\n\n\n\n\nYou can query the connections among structures with these functions:\n\n\n\n\nsource.getConnectionsOut()\n returns a list of unique IDs for\n   connections (which are different than the IDs for structures\n   themselves).  To see what you can do with a connection ID, read on.\n   The IDs are always returned in alphabetical order.\n\n\ntarget.getConnectionsIn()\n functions analogously to the previous, but\n   for connections into a target, rather than out from a source.\n\n\nnode.getAllConnections()\n returns the union of the previous two lists,\n   each entry listed only once (even if the node connects to itself), and\n   still in alphabetical order.\n\n\nStructure.getConnectionSource(ID)\n returns the \nStructure\n instance that\n   is the source for the connection with the given ID (or undefined if the\n   ID is not in use).\n\n\nStructure.getConnectionTarget(ID)\n and \nStructure.getConnectionData(ID)\n\n   are similar to the previous.\n\n\n\n\nExample usage:\n\n\nfunction getConnectionsBetween ( A, B ) {\n    var result = [ ];\n    var connIDs = A.getConnectionsOut();\n    for ( var i = 0 ; i \n connIDs.length ; i++ ) {\n        if ( target == Structure.getConnectionTarget( connIDs[i] ) )\n            result.push( Structure.getConnectionData( connIDs[i] ) );\n    }\n    return result;\n}\n\n\n\n\nYou can transfer all the connections in and out of one \nStructure\n instance\nto another structure instance by calling\n\nfirst.transferConnectionsTo(second)\n.  This is useful if \nsecond\n is about\nto take the place of \nfirst\n, and you want it to inherit all of \nfirst\n's\nconnections.  This may be particularly useful to \ninterpret()\n routines in\nsubclasses of \nInputStructure\n.\n\n\nUnique IDs\n\n\nThe \nStructure\n class maintains a mapping from IDs (as strings) to instances\nof the class.  An instance gets its ID from the attribute with key \"id.\"\nAll IDs in a hierarchy can be tracked (that is, recorded into this\nclass-level mapping) with the \ntrackIDs()\n function documented below.\n\n\nHere are the relevant functions:\n\n\n\n\ninstance.id()\n returns the instance's ID, if it has one, or undefined if\n   not\n\n\ninstance.trackIDs()\n asks the class to update the class variable that\n   maps IDs to instances, recording the connection of all IDs for all nodes\n   in the hierarchy whose root is \ninstance\n.  This will overwrite earlier\n   data in that mapping if and only if you have not kept IDs unique.\n\n\ninstance.untrackIDs()\n removes from the class-level mapping all IDs that\n   appear in the hierarchy whose root is \ninstance\n.  If you are done with\n   a \nStructure\n instance, you must call this function in it, so that its\n   memory is guaranteed to eventually be garbage collected.\n\n\nStructure.instanceWithID(id)\n takes a string ID and yields the instance\n   with that ID, if there is one, and that instance has recorded its ID in\n   the class-level variable for this purpose by means of a call to\n   \ntrackIDs()\n, or null or undefined if there is none.\n\n\n\n\nEvents and event handlers\n\n\nAny \nStructure\n instance fires up to twelve different types of events during\nits lifetime:\n\n\n\n\nwillBeInserted\n\n\nwillBeRemoved\n\n\nwillBeChanged\n\n\nwasInserted\n\n\nwasRemoved\n\n\nwasChanged\n\n\nconnectionWillBeInserted\n\n\nconnectionWillBeRemoved\n\n\nconnectionWillBeChanged\n\n\nconnectionWasInserted\n\n\nconnectionWasRemoved\n\n\nconnectionWasChanged\n\n\n\n\nTo install an event handler for one of these, simply overwrite that key in\nthe \nStructure\n object itself, as in \nmyStructure.willBeRemoved =\nmyHandlerFunction\n.\n\n\nInsertion events are fired immediately before/after the \nStructure\n is added\nas a child under a new parent.  Removal events are fired immediately\nbefore/after the \nStructure\n is removed from an existing parent.  Change\nevents are fired immediately before/after an attribute of the \nStructure\n\ninstance changes.  The same holds true for changing connections, and the\nevents fire on both the source and target of the connection.  (In the case\nwhere the source is the target, this will result in the event firing twice.)\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n    var A = new Structure();\n    var B = new Structure();\n    A.willBeInserted = function () { console.log( 'Now!' ); };\n    B.insertChild( A ); // prints 'Now!' to console just before inserting",

Instances can be converted to and from JSON, for saving to a file, storing\npermanently anywhere, or transmitting across threads or network connections.\nTo ensure that deserialization correctly reconstructs instances of the right\nsubclass of  Structure , each subclass must be registered.

It\n   inserts the new child at that index, thus increasing the number of\n   children by 1.  You may use an index equal to the length of the child\n   list to append.  The child is removed from its previous parent, if any,\n   before being inserted here.  instance.replaceWith(other)  expects another structure instance as its\n   argument.  It removes  instance  from its parent, if there is one, and\n   then inserts  other  at the same index in the parent, thus replacing\n    instance .  This has no effect if  instance  has no parent.  It is\n   equivalent to successive calls to  removeFromParent()  and\n    insertChild()  at the instance and its parent, respectively.  instance.copy()  makes a deep copy of the instance, including all nodes\n   below it in the hierarchy.  This new copy will have all the same IDs as\n   the previous copy, so to preserve uniqueness of IDs, you will usually\n   want to call  copiedInstance.clearIDs()  afterwards.   The order of nodes in the hierarchy is often important.  We have one simple\norder relation on the nodes in the hierarchy and one more complex.  The\nsimplest is just whether node A is \"earlier than\" node B, in the order\ninduced by an in-order tree traversal (that is, the order in which the open\nparentheses would appear if the tree were written as a LISP expression).\nThis relation can be tested with  instance.isEarlierThan(other) .  The more complex order relation is accessibility, which we do not define\nhere, because it is already defined  in the source code\ndocumentation .\nThat relation is implemented with the following member functions available\nin all instances of the class.   A.isAccessibleTo(B)  implements the relation as defined at the link\n   given above.  A.isInTheScopeOf(B)  is equivalent to  B.isAccessibleTo(A) .  A.iteratorOverAccessibles()  yields an \"iterator\" object, which is an\n   object that can produce the list of nodes accessible to  A  by repeated\n   calls to the  next()  member of the object.  Consider the following\n   JavaScript code that would use such an iterator.       var iterator = A.iteratorOverAccessibles();\n    var accessible;\n    while ( accessible = iterator.next() ) {\n        console.log( 'The next accessible structure is:',\n            accessible.toJSON() );\n    }  Nodes are produced by the iterator in reverse order (under the isEarlierThan  relation) starting from the first accessible node before A .  When the  next()  function yields null for the first time, the end of\nthe list has been reached.  (The  next()  function will yield null forever\nthereafter.)  Iterators are more efficient than producing the entire list and returning\nit, because the client may be seeking just one particular node in the list,\nand thus producing the entire list so that the client can search just a\nsmall part of it could be wasteful.  There is an analogous function for scopes.   A.iteratorOverScope()  functions like  A.iteratorOverAccessibles() , but\n   walks forwards through the structure, including precisely those nodes for\n   which  B.isInTheScopeOf(A)  holds true.   There are then four functions that use these iterators under the hood.\nClients will most likely wish to use these rather than have direct access\nto the iterators.   A.firstAccessible(P)  expects  P  to be a one-place predicate (that is,\n   a JavaScript function that can be evaluated on a single argument, and\n   yields true or false in each case) and yields the first item on the\n   \"accessibles\" list (as given by  A.iteratorOverAccessibles() ) for which\n    P  yields true.  It returns undefined if there is no such thing.  A.firstInScope(P)  expects  P  to be a one-place predicate, as just\n   defined, and behaves just like  firstAccessible() , except it walks\n   through  A.iteratorOverScope()  instead.  A.allAccessibles(P)  expects  P  as in the previous two functions, and\n   yields all nodes accessible to  A  that satisfy  P , in the same order\n   they would be reported by  iteratorOverAccessibles() .

If you call it with a false argument (to mark the\nStructure clean) then it operates on only the Structure in which you called\nit.

You can call\n\nX.feedback(Y)\n in any \nInputStructure\n \nX\n, passing any JSON object \nY\n\ncontaining the feedback you wish to send, and it will add \nX.id()\n as the\n\nsubject\n field of \nY\n, then call the LDE's global feedback function to\ntransmit \nY\n to the client.\n\n\nThis transmission takes different forms depending on the client.  See the\n\nrelevant section in the LDE API documentation\n.\n\n\nCreating Default IDs\n\n\nDebugging and testing the Input and Output Trees is simplified if the IDs of\n\nOutputStructure\ns in the Output Tree somehow correlate with the IDs of\ntheir originating nodes in the Input Tree. It is also convenient if\n\nOutputStructure\ns have default IDs assigned, without each subclass of\n\nInputStructure\n having to specify how it assigns those IDs.\n\n\nThe \nassignCorrespondingIDs\n function is called by \nrecursiveInterpret()\n to\ndo just that.  An \nInputStructure\n with ID x would have the\n\nOutputStructures\n in its interpretation automatically given IDs x.0, x.1,\nx.2, and so on.\n\n\nClients do not need to call this function.  But subclasses that want to\nremove or change its behavior can override it.\n\n\nLabels\n\n\nEach \nOutputStructure\n can be labeled as documented\n\nhere\n. Interpretation can attach labels by\nassigning a \nhasLabel()\n function into any \nOutputStructure\n it creates.\nSince this is very common and yet a bit annoying to code, we establish a few\nconventions that are respected by the built-in \nInputStructure\n function\n\naddLabels()\n, which is called by the default implementation of\n\nrecursiveInterpret()\n.  They are:\n\n\n\n\nIf an \nInputStructure\n \nX\n has an attribute with key \n\"label regex\"\n then\n   any \nOutputStructure\n in \nX.lastInterpretation\n will be assigned a\n   \nhasLabel()\n function that checks its argument against the value of that\n   attribute, after converting it to a \nRegExp\n object.\n\n\nIf an \nInputStructure\n \nX\n has an attribute with key\n   \n\"label regex flags\"\n then that attribute's value will be used in the\n   construction of the \nRegExp\n mentioned above, as its flags.\n\n\nIf an \nInputStructure\n has an attribute with key \n\"label targets\"\n with\n   value \n[i_1,i_2,...,i_N]\n then only the interpretation outputs whose\n   indices are \ni_1\n or \ni_2\n or ... or \ni_N\n are labeled.\n\n\n\n\nCitations\n\n\nSimilar to the previous section, we have some default conventions for\ncopying citations from the Input Tree to the Output Tree during\ninterpretation.  These conventions are implemented in a function called\n\ncopyCitations()\n (the analogue of \naddLabels()\n), but any subclass that\ndoes not like these defaults can override that method to change them.\n\n\n\n\nIf an \nInputStructure\n has a \n\"premise citations\"\n or\n   \n\"reason citations\"\n attribute then the value should be a list of\n   strings, labels of the premises being cited.  (Or it can be a single\n   string, which will be treated as a one-element array.)  Such an\n   attribute is copied directly into the \nOutputStructure\ns that are the\n   interpretation.  (Both attributes are permitted, or one, or none.)\n\n\nIf an \nInputStructure\n has a connection coming in or going out, and the\n   connection's data has \ntype\n equal to \n\"premise citation\"\n or\n   \n\"reason citation\"\n, then that connection should somehow be transferred\n   to the Output Tree.  This comes with a few fiddly details that are\n   documented in \nthe comments on the source code\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nInputExpression\n class\n\n\nAn \nInputExpression\n is the type of \nInputStructure\n that the LDE will\ninterpret into meaningful content in its Output Tree.  This is the first of\ntwo \nInputStructure\n subclasses.  They are intended to be the \nonly\n two\n\nInputStructure\n subclasses; most other things should be subclasses of one\nof these two.\n\n\nInputExpression\ns are what we typically think of as the meaningful things\nin the Input Tree.  They will have interpretation routines that will\nproduce nodes in the Output Tree.\n\n\nTo do their job, they have the following features.  (Some of these make more\nsense if you've skipped ahead and read the purpose of \nInputModifier\ns\nfirst.)\n\n\n\n\nAn \nupdateData()\n function, which imports from any \nInputModifier\n\n   connected to the expression all the data that such a modifier wishes to\n   import, by calling \nupdateDataIn()\n in the modifier, passing the\n   expression as parameter.\n\n\nSeveral functions for tracking which attributes of the expression were\n   written by modifiers.  (See the miscellaneous technical details\n   documented in \nthe relevant section of the source code\n.)\n\n\nThree convenience functions to make it easier for \nInputModifier\n\n   instances to implement their \nupdateDataIn()\n functions without causing\n   collisions or overwriting of data in expressions.  See the documentation\n   in \nthe relevant section of the source code\n.\n\n\n\n\nThe \nDependency\n class\n\n\nThe client may permit the user to write a document that begins by importing\nthe meaning expressed in some other, saved document.  We call that other,\nsaved document a \"dependency\" of the first.  To support this, we permit the\nembedding into the Input Tree of the first document the meaning already\nstored in the Output Tree of the dependency.  Interpretation can then just\ncopy that information over to the Output Tree as if it had been there all\nalong (which is the intent of importing a dependency in the first place).\n\n\nThis class supports that by permitting the user to contsruct a \nDependency\n\nin the Input Tree, passing it the list of \nOutputStructure\n instances that\nhave been loaded from the Output Tree of the dependency document it\nrepresents.  Whenever it is interpreted, it just passes those same values\nalong into the Output Tree.\n\n\nThe \nInputModifier\n class\n\n\nAn \nInputModifier\n is the type of \nInputStructure\n that will modify\n\nInputExpression\ns, and thus impact how they are interpreted.  It does not\ndirectly have an interpretation in the Output Tree itself, but only impacts\nthe interpretation of zero or more \nInputExpression\ns.\n\n\nTo support that, they have this functionality:\n\n\n\n\nAn overridden constructor and \ninsertChild()\n routine that prevent adding\n   children to an \nInputModifier\n instance.\n\n\nDefault (noop) implementations of \nupdateConnections()\n and\n   \nupdateDataIn()\n that subclasses can override.\n\n\nAn implementation of \ninterpret()\n that always returns an empty array.\n\n\n\n\nThe most common way to use this class will probably be to instead use the\nfollowing simple subclass.\n\n\nThe \nBasicInputModifier\n class\n\n\nThe most common purpose of modifiers is probably going to be embedding\nattributes into their targets.  To that end, we provide a class that does\nexactly that.\n\n\nIt contains support for calling any of the three convenience functions that\nexpressions expose to modifiers: \nsetSingleValue\n, \naddListItem\n, and\n\naddSetElement\n.  The data for these calls can be given at construction time\nso that one need not subclass this further to get the desired functionality,\nbut can just instantiate it instead.\n\n\nHere is an example:\n\n\nvar example = new BasicInputModifier(\n    [ 'color', 'red', 'setSingleValue' ],\n    [ 'brother', 'Steve', 'addSetElement' ],\n    [ 'brother', 'Eric', 'addSetElement' ]\n);\nexample.updateDataIn( expression );\n// does all of the following:\n// expression.setSingleValue( 'color', 'red' );\n// expression.addSetElement( 'brother', 'Steve' );\n// expression.addSetElement( 'brother', 'Eric' );",

Each modifier should\ntake that opportunity to connect itself to the correct modification targets.\nThe reason for this is because those connections will govern, in the\nsubsequent interpretation phase, which expressions ask which modifiers to\nembed data in the expressions.  In order for the expressions to make those\nrequests correctly, the modifiers need to decide in the modification phase\nwhich expressions they should target.\n\n\nInterpretation\n\n\nThe interpretatin phase follows immediately after the modification phase;\nindeed, the modification phase terminates by passing control directly to the\ninterpretation phase.\n\n\nIn this phase, the contents of the Input Tree (which can be thought of as a\ngeneralized kind of syntax, representing anything the user wrote in the\nclient and the client passed on to the LDE) are \ninterpreted\n into the\nOutput Tree (which can be thought of as the usable mathematical meaning of\nthe user's content).  Thus this phase is like a compiler in computer\nscience, or an interpretation function in model theory; it maps syntax to\n(actionable) semantics.\n\n\nIt is implemented in the \nrunInterpretation()\n method of the LDE's API,\ndocumented \nhere\n.\n\n\nThat function runs \nrecursiveInterpret()\n on the root of the Input Tree, a\nfunction implemented in \nthe InputStructure class\n.\nThat function recursively traverses the Input Tree, runs the \ninterpret()\n\nfunction at each node, and assembles their results into the new Output Tree.\n\n\nSome types of policing are done to ensure that \nrecursiveInterpret()\n and\n\ninterpret()\n behave as they ought to, even if they are redefined in\nsubclasses not yet written.  For more information, see the errors that may\nbe generated as feedback, \ndocumented here\n.\n\n\nValidation\n\n\nThe validation phase follows immediately after the interpretation phase;\nindeed, the interpretation phase terminates by calling its callback and then\nenqueueing for validation any \nOutputStructure\n that it detects needs to be\nvalidated.\n\n\nThis uses a validation priority queue built into the LDE, which leverages a\npool of workers in background threads to do the validation in parallel,\nusing as many simultaneously as possible (at least one worker, but no more\nthan the number of cores on the machine minus one, to leave one thread free\nfor the user interface).\n\n\n\n\nFor details on the pool of workers, see\n   \nthis section of the source code\n.\n\n\nFor details on each individual worker in the pool, see\n   \nthe source for the \nLDEWorker\n class\n\n   or\n   \nthe source code run in each worker\n,\n   which work hand-in-hand.\n\n\nFor details on the priority queue, see\n   \nthis section of the source code\n.\n\n\n\n\nAn \nOutputStructure\n \nS\n is validated by calling\n\nS.validate(worker,callback)\n, with the first parameter being an \nLDEWorker\n\ninstance available for use (see documentation link above) and the second\nparameter being the function to call when the work is complete (passing no\nparameters).  That validation function should generate feedback about \nS\n\nbut does not need to mark \nS\n clean nor actively return its worker to the\nqueue; those things happen automatically. It can feel free to use the entire\nAPI for the \nLDEWorker\n class, including installing scripts, functions, or\ndata as needed.\n\n\nWhen the last \nOutputStructure\n that needed validation finishes it, feedback\nof type \"validation complete\" is emitted by the LDE.\n\nMore details on types of feedback appear here.",
